The LIDAR used by AiCEDT will not be a conventional LIDAR,
it will be a lidar with a beam of 15 µm in diameter at most to allow AiCEDT to detect the physical characteristics of the target cell accurately,
this LIDAR will work by focusing light from 2 light emitters using a circuit of small mirrors perfectly aligned with an opening point at the bottom of the structure that will hold the LIDAR components,
this opening will be 15.2 µm in diameter, and the light sensor itself will basically be like a common light sensor but capable of capturing light in a narrow beam.
