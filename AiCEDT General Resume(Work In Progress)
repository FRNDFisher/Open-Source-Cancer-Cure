"The AiCEDT treatment (Artificial Intelligence Controlled Direct Energy Treatment) will be a highly advanced treatment used to cure any disease caused by defective cells or viruses that are not combatable by vaccines, such as Cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, among many others.

The treatment will use a machine called UPEE (Ultra Precise Energy Emitter) that will employ a directed energy emitter mounted on a multi-axis robotic arm with micrometric or even nanometric precision. This arm will be controlled by an advanced artificial intelligence that will use data from 8 sensors mounted on the arm (Spectrometer, Lidar with nanometric precision, an ultra-high precision radar, and a mass spectrometer). There are 8 sensors because the UPEE will have 2 of each to prevent failures and to allow the AI to compare results.

The directed energy emitter will be a conventional laser, but with a highly focused beam. The AI of the UPEE will control the laser, analyzing the cancerous cellâ€™s mass, density, resistance, etc., so that the laser only damages the cancerous cell and not healthy cells. In the case of a calculation failure, the AI will detect this and immediately shut off the laser.

Depending on where the disease is located, surgery may be required. For example, if the disease is in the lung, a small surgery will be needed to open the thoracic cavity to allow the laser to act on the lung.

The UPEE will be so precise that it will destroy cancerous cells one by one. Even though the arm is controlled by AI and is fast, it will destroy each cancerous cell individually, achieving an efficacy of nearly 100%, as it destroys each cell."
